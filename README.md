gii-bbcode
==========
The gii-bbcode plugin is an easy to install, but yet very flexible
component to view and edit bbcode content. It is very configurable and
has language support. It converts bbcoded content completely on the
client side, thus minimizing server utilization. It is out-of-the-box
integrated with the Twitter Bootstrap, but also works without it.
